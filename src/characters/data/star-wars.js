Not only was he able to accomplish this, but he also managed to keep his plan hidden from the Jedi the entire time. It wasnt until Anakin Skywalker discovered his true identity that things nearly came unraveled, but by then, it was too late.  The rule of the Galactic Empire started and ended with Palpatine brutally controlling everything and did not possess an ounce of humanity or compassion for those living under his direction. Palpatines only goal was to achieve more power and, through that, immortality.  Through the years, his abilities became so strong that he could not only generate Force Lightning but use it to destroy entire fleets, as seen in Rise of Skywalker. His power also grew to such a point that, as he alluded to in Revenge of the Sith, he was able to cheat death. When Darth Vader threw his body into the Death Star reactor, he could transfer his consciousness into a clone body on Exegol, a planet across the galaxy. From there, he used his scheming skills again, orchestrating the rise of the First Order, the creation of Supreme Leader Snoke as a puppet, and the Final Order, nearly conquering the galaxy again.  His power was seemingly incalculable, and if he were to face off against any other Sith Lord, he would likely defeat them with ease.'

They then worked together to try and exterminate the Jedi, nearly destroying the Order entirely. He was defeated by the Jedi Exile, his former apprentice Visas Marr, and Mandalore the Preserver, who managed to sever his connection to the Force long enough for him to be slain.What made Nihilus so powerful was that he lacked any sort of humanity that he once had, becoming a creature fueled by the Force and nothing else. After he and Sion began their purge, a large gathering of Jedi met on the planet Katarr where Nihilus drained the planet of its Force energy.It devastated the planet, killed nearly everyone on it, and cemented Nihilus place amongst Sith legend.'

Darth Bane was the lone Sith survivor of the final battle of that war, and he realized that there needed to change for the order to survive.Bane established the "Rule of Two," which stated that rather than massive armies of soldiers, the Sith would have no more than two members at any given time—a Master and an apprentice. The Master would teach the apprentice everything until they grew strong enough to defeat their Master.This rule would continue for thousands of years, but some Sith definitely played fast and loose with it. For example, Count Dooku was Sidious apprentice, but Dooku also had Asajj Ventress as a learner.
